## OCTA toolbox

The OCTA Python toolbox was created by Van Geert, Bossens, and Wagemans (2021) as a tool for researchers to create stimuli varying in order and complexity on different dimensions. This GitHub repository contains a workshop explaining the main components in the octa Python package.

A graphical user interface for OCTA is available in the form of a [Shiny app](https://elinevg.shinyapps.io/OCTA_toolbox/).
